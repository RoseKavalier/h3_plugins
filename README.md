# h3_plugins
Various plugins for HoMM3 to be used with HDmod.

# Description
**AnchorBugFix** ensures the obstacles' anchor is situated within the obstacle itself. This enables Forcefield, Firewall, Quicksand and Land Mine to be placed at visually "free" tiles that were previously blocked off.

**Castle Lighthouse** only applies the Castle's Lighthouse building naval movement bonus to its owner, instead of to everybody.

**CombinationArtifacts** allows you to compile your own plugin that modifies what goes into combination artifacts.

**Starting Heroes** allows the selection from extra heroes that are enabled for the current town. Not much testing done - USE AT OWN RISK.

**ScholarSecondarySkillChoice** when visiting a Wandering Scholar on the Adventure map, you will be able to decline or accept any offered secondary skill.

**TownDependencies** allows you to compile your own plugin that modifies the requirements for building town structures of your choice.
